# Hindi-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

This project is Deep Learning Web Interfaced Hindi Digit recognition project. For sake of simplicity flask backend is used to minimize complexities. The Application provides users with an intuitive interface to draw the digits and the predictio is done by the model.
or draw digits directly on a canvas for prediction. 

### Tools used :
- Jupyter Notebooks - Model Building , Data analysis , Exporting model
- Flask - Python Backend library for Simple Backend with python integrations
- Bootstrap - Clean Looking Frontend Web face
- DrawingBoard.js - Used to Build the Drawable Canvas element
- Javascript - Lightwieght JS used for DOM manipulation

### Working :
- You draw the character on canvas 
- Image Data URI is pulled to backed after you press predict
- Image Data URI is converted to PNG Image and downshaped
- Convolutional Model is loaded using loaded
- PNG image is shaped like model input i.e. 4D (1 ,? , ? , 1)
- Model is used to Predict the Output of Image passed
- Output and Image code (Generated by Server) is sent to Frontend in JSON
- Front End DOM updation using JS
